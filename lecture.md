# Lecture notes on Trusted Research

Authored by James Hetherington.

Funded through the EPSRC Digital Health Hub for Antimicrobial Resistance

## Introduction

## Principles for Trusted Research

### Trusted Research as an Influence on Research

Not just a productivity trade-off. 
Sociotechnical problems.

### Impossibility of perfect security for any remote-access TRE

The photographic hole

#### Defence in depth

### The policy context

Goldacre report, NHS "control" whatever that means.
Importance of cross-sectoral data linking

### Tiered approaches to sensitivity

Understanding threat actors

Who classifies?

### Five Safes

## The analytical environment

### Software ingress

#### Allow and deny lists

#### Harmful software in repositories

### Data ingress

#### Security as a property of the work package

#### Sensitivity as a property of data combination

#### Increased sensitivity as a property of work

#### Toward flowing data and continuous ingress

Data immutability

### Disclosure control

#### k-anon

#### Disclosure control for AIs

Graimatter

#### Technical support for social processes

Every action auditable
Governance assisted through technology

#### Automated egress

Dashboards.
Implications for federated learning.

### Compute requirements for modern data science

Typical problem sizes

## Implications from infrastructure-as-code

### Security through obscurity and the open approach to TREs

### IAC and Governance

The code is the audit, and the audit is the code?
Github flow and change control.

### The cloud and IAC

Existing solutions - Treehoose, Turing, AWS environment...

On-prem clouds, Terraform and k8s

### Toward a shared design for TREs

SATRE

### The TRE factory

Separation of environments

Instances, separation of codebase from service wrap

Implications for NHS policy and research-NHS collaboration

## Synthetic data

### Why work with synthetic data?

### An alternative to TREs: the Opensafely Approach

Drawbacks? Interactive exploration vs blinding...

## Trusted Innovation

TREs as a platform for impact. Software as a medical device.
